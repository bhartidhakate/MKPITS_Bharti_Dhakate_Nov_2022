	<p>Physical Description
Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and 
adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely 
determined by age, genetics and hormones. Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.

Without their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart.</p>

<p>Size
Lions stand between 3.5 and 4 feet (1 and 1.2 meters) tall at the shoulder. Males grow to lengths of 10 feet (3 meters) and have a 2 to 3 foot 
(60 to 91 centimeter) tail. They weigh from 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms). Slightly smaller, females grow to lengths of 9 feet 
(2.7 meters) and weigh between 265 and 395 pounds.</p>

<p>Native Habitat
Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest. Except for a small population of the Indian lion 
subspecies that remains in the Gir Forest of northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern 
South Africa.  They are absent from equatorial areas dominated by moist tropical forest.</p>
